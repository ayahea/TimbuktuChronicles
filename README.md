# TimbuktuChronicles
This is a digital humanities research project aimed at exploring two chronicles written in the 17th century about historical West Africa: Tarikh al-fattash by Mahmud Kati, and Tarikh al-Sudan by ʻAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʻAbd Allāh Saʻdī

This project aims to make these texts, or certain passages from them, more accessible. Some possible integrations include geo-tagging, named-entity recognition, improved Arabic OCR for the texts, and others.
